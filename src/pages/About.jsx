      <p>
        This app is designed to help teachers manage and distribute math
        problems provided by the education department. All problems are imported
        into the app, sorted, and organized for easy access. As a teacher, you
        can create teams for each of your classes and assign them specific
        problems. The app keeps track of which problems have already been given
        to each team, helping you avoid repetition and ensuring a smoother
        planning process. Whether you're managing one class or several, this
        tool simplifies your workflow and supports more effective teaching.
